Destruct-A-Truck Game Report. 

My game demo features two levels.
In the first level is almost like a quick tutorial. The win condition is you get above a score of 15 within 15 seconds and you can progress to level 2. 
The first level is a very open space for the player. How the player gets their points and builds up their score is by running into the the popping boxes
that can be seen on the screen.

There is a level of progress that can be seen from the first to the next between the control on the truck and the overall look and design. All assets I used
can be seen in my wiki along with my first game plan. 
The second level is set in a forest space, the idea of the world being huge is to set a cute and toy-like atmosphere for the player. In this level to keep within the forest theme
I used two different looking mushrooms instead of boxes. 
The mushrooms have different values, associated with them. Mushrooms that glow blue give you points and more time within the play area. Mushrooms that glow yellow only give you the
points. I added the glowing affect to make it easier to see the mushrooms when they're under the shadows of the trees or from across the map. This way the player can plan pathing
through the map and decide what colour mushroom they need to go for next.
The mushrooms are also moving on the map between waypoints, so the player cant just memerize where they are, they have to be alert and engage with the game.

The camera angles are different in both levels. I didn't think too much about the angle for the first level as it's a quick-play level. The camera on the second level is made to 
show the difference in how the truck drives. There are a couple bumps around the forest-map. When you tap against or drive over one you will notice the suspension as you'll also
notice a bob in the camera. 

Score and time are both displayed on the screen.

Reflection.
The demo has a few minor issues. 
The score and time text needs to be worked on to look nicer and be clearer for the player.
I think the driving on the quick-play level could be alot smoother. The particle system also triggers a collision to the player, I think this is
because it's attached to the box object and the box has colliders. This does make it easier for presentation purposes as you'll definitly get through the tutorial.
The map could definitly be more populated. 

In further development I would like to add a high-score board that shows the highest scores players have gotten.
I would also love to have a more populated map with other elements to collect. Example- a collectable that allows you double points. A collectable that stops the timer for 4
seconds.
